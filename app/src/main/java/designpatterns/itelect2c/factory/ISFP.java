They are fun to be with and very spontaneous, which makes them the perfect friend to tag along in whatever activity, regardless if planned or unplanned. ISFPs want to live their life to the fullest and embrace the present, so they make sure they are always out to explore new things and discover new experiences. It is in experience that they find wisdom, so they do see more value in meeting new people than other introverts.";
